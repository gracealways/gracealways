      <p>
        <b>History</b>
          <br>
        
      <p>
        Grace Always Preparatory School, (GAPS) formerly the Kings Preparatory School (KPS) was birthed out of a dream of a young man and beloved wife in 1965 as a private primary institution. By dint of hard work, the founder, James Boafo Darko was successfully carved a niche for the Institute as the only basic educational institution to train kids in the whole of West Africa at the time. The institution has undergone a lot of restructuring over the years through to where it is today.

        From a humble beginning as a Private Primary School in 1965, the Institution was taken over and managed by his wife, 1979. Subsequently, on 22nd April 1999, the Grace Always Preparatory School, Act 566 was passed to establish the Institute to Junior High School with the responsibility of providing junior high education in the academic disciplines of Accountancy and Management.
        <br>
        
      <p>

       With great fortitude and hard work, the Presidential Charter was granted to the Institute in September, 2008 making it a fully-fledged Junior High School capable of participatiing in the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE). In 2012, the Grace Always Preparatory School Act 2012, Act 850 was passed to change the name of the Institution from Kings Preparatory School to Grace Always Preparatory School.
        
        Repositioned as a fully-fledged Private Institution with its unique mandate to provide academic and professional education, the school is poised towards attaining scholarship, professionalism and quality educational programmes. From an initial enrolment of five students in 1965, the school currently can boast of over 5,000 students with an average number of 200 students enrolling in every term.
